A novel statistical evaluation approach to the effects of reimbursement schemes on hospital performance.  

we present a novel statistical evaluation approach to the effects of reimbursement schemes on hospital performance.  The approach is implemented in R. 

This framework has the potential to serve as a basic analysis framework to evaluate other reimbursement schemes and more complex measurements variables with the different healthcare systems. 

Feel free to contact me via if you have any questions w.r.t using the code via 181601043@csu.edu.cn.
